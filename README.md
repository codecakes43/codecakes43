### Hi there 👋

# 💻👩‍💻

Hello! I'm Oliwia, a young programmer who is fascinated by the world of technology and coding. My heart beats for code, and my mind is filled with a passion for creating new things.

## My Journey with Programming

My programming journey started in high school when I enrolled in a class with a focus on mathematics and computer science. Along the way, I also stumbled upon my other passion - cooking. Inspired by this, I decided to create a blog, where I started making small code adjustments to tailor it to my requirements.

Few years later I started working as a robotics and programming instructor. Recently, I accomplished a significant milestone by completing a course and obtaining a certificate in JavaScript. I'm excited about the opportunities this knowledge brings and eager to continue my learning and growth in the programming field.

## My Current Challenge - React ⚛️

Currently, I'm learning React - a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Delving into reactive programming and components is the next step in my path to becoming a versatile front-end developer.

## Satisfaction in Results 🌟

The thing I love the most about programming is seeing the results of my work. The view of a functioning application, which required my effort and creativity, gives me immense satisfaction. I'm always ready to take on challenges and continuously improve my skills.

## My Motto 💪

In my programming journey, I follow one motto - "Never stop learning." By acquiring new skills, I develop my abilities and expand my horizons. I see limitless possibilities in programming, and I'm eager to tackle any challenge this exciting field brings my way.

## Summary 🌈

I am Oliwia - a young, passionate programmer who creates and thrives in the world of code. I enjoy coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and currently, I'm learning React. New challenges and continuous discoveries drive me to action. I'm thrilled to share my passion with others and create something valuable for the world of technology. 🚀😊
